7-Dec :  Prayer For relationship with Ashley to grow deeper and in different facets of love. In learning patience in conversations and calibrating to differences in processing decisions and emotions. For Wedding planning and Ashley’s stress/capacity to deal with it. For productivity as he looks to begin school again. For the Spirit’s guidance in discussions about politics, especially with CG. Patience for Alex and reasonable thinking for those he has discussions with.
