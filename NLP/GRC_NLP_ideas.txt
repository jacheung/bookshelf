NLP idea 1: 

Within GRC testimonies, they seem to be packed full of information. 
Reading through Bret Lane's testimony I find that there is an inherent structure already. 
This structure can be denoted by roman numerals (I,II,III) and capitalized alphabets (A,B,C). 
Within each segment and using some NLP software can we - 
highlight the most important (top 2?) sentences within each segment while retaining the title heads?

To do: 
- highlight what you think are the best summary sentences for each section in the Bret Lane testimony 
- Py2PDF or some PDF to text generator to place into python 
- Chunk text based on Roman Numerals and Alphabets
- TextRank within each paragraph.
